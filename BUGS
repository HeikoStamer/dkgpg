 - dkg-generate >= 1.1.3 is incompatible to previous releases (additional 0x1f-
   signature on primary key that contains the same properties (e.g. expiration)
   as the somehow obligatory self-signature on the initial user ID)
 - interactive programs of DKGPG >= 1.0.8 are incompatible to previous releases
 - dkg-decrypt of DKGPG < 1.1.2 fails on many ZIP-compressed OpenPGP messages
   with "ZLIB ERROR: -3 invalid block type" due to a bug in decompression logic
 - dkg-decrypt of DKGPG < 1.1.2 fails in a special case of SKESK V4 decryption
 - S2K computation of LibTMCG < 1.3.18 generates wrong session key for SKESK, if
   hash length < symmetric key length (e.g. s2k_hashalgo = 2 and skalgo = 9)

No further bugs are known. Please report!
