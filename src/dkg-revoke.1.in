.TH DKG\-REVOKE "1" "August 2017" "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
dkg\-revoke \- threshold revocation protocol for OpenPGP (only DSA/DSS)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-revoke
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program revokes an OpenPGP primary key and the corresponding subkey,
where the private DSA key has been shared between multiple parties by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
For a successful revocation at least 2s+1 different participants must join
the protocol and provide their corresponding signature shares. The threshold
parameter s has been fixed during distributed key generation and cannot
changed at this stage of processing. The program needs the corresponding
privat key file as generated by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
The results, i.e., the key revocation signatures, are written to the public
key file in ASCII-armored OpenPGP format.
.PP
The program employs GNUnet for exchange of protocol messages, where PEERS
must be a sufficient subset (i.e. at least 2s+1 parties) of the GNUnet peer
identities used during distributed key generation with
.BR dkg\-generate (1)
including the calling peer.
.PP
By the additional option "-r" the caller can specify a reason for revocation
(machine-readable code) as defined by RFC 4880:
.RS 4
\fB 0\fR No reason specified
\fB 1\fR Key is superseded
\fB 2\fR Key material has been compromised
\fB 3\fR Key is retired and no longer used
.RE
The default value is zero (no reason specified). This reason must be the
same for all parties who run the revocation protocol. Otherwise the
generation of the revocation signature will fail.
.PP
The established communication channels for the protocols should be
protected with bilateral exchanged passwords for encryption and message
authentication, if the underlying P2P network does not guarantee required
confidentiality and integrity by itself. The passwords for all channels
are defined as a string, where a slash (/) marks the end of each password.
The order of the passwords depends on position of each peer in the
canonicalized peer list, i.e., the sorted unique list of given PEERS. For
example, if participant R_0 uses A/B/C/ as password string, then "B" is
the password for his channel to R_1 and "C" is the password for his channel
to R_2. That means R_1 and R_2 have to provide matching password strings,
i.e., B/D/E/ and C/E/F/, respectively. The default value of option "-P" is
an empty password string (simple default passwords) based on the assumption,
that GNUnet will protect the exchanged protocol messages.
.PP
Additionally, instead of relying on GNUnet CADET the protocol messages can
be exchanged by the built-in TCP/IP communication framework. In that case
the given peer identities from PEERS are simple resolvable hostnames and the
corresponding option "-H" defines the hostname of the calling peer within
that list. The program binds some TCP ports up from 55000 to listen for
incoming connections and connects to other peers in that port range.
Since the communication is not protected by the network itself "-P" is
a mandatory option in that case.

.SH "SECURITY"
The current implementation is in experimental state and should NOT
be used in production environments.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
The following command revokes the shared keys with three participants defined by their GNUnet peer identities (3PT1...4530, S41S...G3N0, WS3K...QKFG). The signature in armored OpenPGP format is written to foo.txt.asc and can be verified by any OpenPGP implementation.

dkg-revoke -r 1 -w 10 3PT18Z2345NA6FM86BKVJ32DK88KXF0YWKTDPPQX1QJMBPEF4530 S41SNHFSGVR3A88ZPX3ZB3BKD2EN0Z29VEKKS1BMVMQNMWSRG3N0 WS3KHEYKKF6QQ6NDQKKCJ2B374RSSXJ05TB5D9W9FYKPPEJ3QKFG
.RE
.fi
.PP
At least 2s+1 parties must run such a process with the same revocation reason (here: key is superseded). The program waits ten minutes before the revocation protocol is started, because establishing a CADET channel with GNUnet may take some time.
