.SH NAME
dkg\-revoke \-\- generate revocation certificate for OpenPGP key

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-revoke
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generates a revocation certificate for a OpenPGP primary key or a
single associated subkey. As in other programs of the DKGPG suite the issuing
key is distributed, i.e., the private part has been shared between multiple
parties by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
That means, for successful generation of a revocation certificate at least 2s+1
different participants must join the protocol and provide their corresponding
signature shares w.r.t. the issuing key. The threshold parameter s has been
fixed during distributed key generation and cannot changed at this stage of
processing. The program requires the privat key file as generated by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
The result, technically called "Key Revocation Signature", is either written to
a file (option "\-o") or printed on STDOUT. If the option "\-s" is used, then
the revocation certificate is generated for a single subkey specified by its
fingerprint. The option "\-i" points to a file that contains the key to revoke
in ASCII-armor. If this option is omitted, then a revocation certificate for
the issuing key is generated.
.PP
The program employs GNUnet for exchange of protocol messages, where PEERS
must be a sufficient subset (i.e. at least 2s+1 parties) of the GNUnet peer
identities used during distributed key generation with
.BR dkg\-generate (1)
including the calling peer.
.PP
By the additional option "\-r" the caller can specify a reason for revocation
(machine\-readable code) as defined by RFC 4880:
.RS 4
\fB 0\fR No reason specified
\fB 1\fR Key is superseded
\fB 2\fR Key material has been compromised
\fB 3\fR Key is retired and no longer used
.RE
The default value is zero (no reason specified). Moreover, with the option "\-R"
the reason for revocation can be defined as a string in human-readable form.
Please note that both options must have the same value for all parties who run
the revocation program. Otherwise the generation of the revocation signatures
will fail.
.PP
With the option "\-w" the number of minutes can be adjusted until the
revocation protocol is started. The default value is 5. It is crucial that
all participants are connected with GNUnet CADET within this waiting time.
Otherwise the revocation may fail.
The option "\-W" defines the timeout of a message within the point\-to\-point
network. The default value is 5 minutes. If the underlying network transport
(i.e. GNUnet CADET or TCP/IP) is very slow then this value should be
increased by all particpants. 
.PP
The established communication channels for the protocols should be
protected with bilateral exchanged passwords for encryption and message
authentication, if the underlying P2P network does not guarantee required
confidentiality and integrity by itself. The passwords for all channels
are defined as a string, where a slash (/) marks the end of each password.
The order of the passwords depends on position of each peer in the
canonicalized peer list, i.e., the sorted unique list of given PEERS. For
example, if participant R_0 uses A/B/C/ as password string, then "B" is
the password for his channel to R_1 and "C" is the password for his channel
to R_2. That means R_1 and R_2 have to provide matching password strings,
i.e., B/D/E/ and C/E/F/, respectively. The default value of option "\-P" is
an empty password string (simple default passwords) based on the assumption,
that GNUnet will protect the exchanged protocol messages.
.PP
Instead of relying on GNUnet CADET service the messages can be exchanged by
the built\-in TCP/IP communication framework. In that case the given peer
identities from PEERS must be resolvable hostnames and the corresponding option
"\-H" defines the name of the calling peer within that list. The program binds
some TCP ports up from 55000 to listen for incoming connections and connects
to other peers in that port range. The used port numbers are determined by the
unique position of the name in the canonicalized peer list. Since the
communication of TCP/IP is not protected by the network itself the option "\-P"
is mandatory in that case.

.SH "SECURITY"
The current implementation is in experimental state and should NOT
be used in production environments.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
The following command generates a revocation certificate for the shared issuing
key with three participants defined by their GNUnet peer identities (3PT1...4530,
S41S...G3N0, WS3K...QKFG). The certificate in armored OpenPGP format is written
to file "revoked.asc" and can be imported by any OpenPGP implementation.

.RE
.fi
.PP
At least 2s+1 parties must run such a process with the same revocation reason
(here: key is superseded). The program waits ten minutes before the revocation
protocol is started, because establishing a CADET channel with GNUnet may take
some time.
