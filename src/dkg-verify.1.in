.TH DKG\-VERIFY "1" "March 2018" "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
dkg\-verify \- verifies a detached signature of a file according to OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-verify
.RI [ options ]
.IR KEYFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program verifies a detached signature read from STDIN according to the OpenPGP standard.
KEYFILE must contain the ASCII\-armored public key, for which the verification is performed.
That means, KEYFILE must contain the corresponding public key of the signature issuer.
Currently, only DSA/DSS and RSA are permitted as public-key algorithms. The input file for
which the signature is checked must be specified by the mandatory option "\-i".
.PP
By "\-f" and "\-t" the user can provide a validity period, i.e., signatures made before the
TIMESPEC of option "\-f" or after the TIMESPEC of option "\-t" are not valid. The corresponding
TIMESPEC must be of the format "YYYY-MM-DD[_HH:MM:SS]". The default values are
"2009-06-01 00:00:00 (publication date of FIPS 186-3)" and the current system date, respectively.

.PP
The program returns a non\-zero value on error, e.g., if the detached signature is invalid or
no admissible public key is found in KEYFILE.
