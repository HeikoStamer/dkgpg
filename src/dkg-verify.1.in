.SH NAME
dkg\-verify \-\- verifies a detached signature of a file according to OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-verify
.RI [ options ]
.IR KEYFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program verifies a detached signature read from STDIN according to the
OpenPGP standard. KEYFILE represents the (ASCII\-armored) public key, for which
the verification is performed. If KEYFILE is omitted and by option "\-k" a file
containing a set of keys (keyring) is given, the corresponding public key is
determined by the issuer fingerprint or issuer subpacket from the signature.
Optionally with "\-k" some external revocation keys can be provided by the user.
Currently, DSA/DSS, RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA are permitted as public\-key
algorithms. The input file for which the signature is checked must be specified
by the mandatory option "\-i". Instead of reading the detached signature from
STDIN, by option "\-s" a file containing this signature can be supplied.
.PP
By "\-f" and "\-t" the user can provide a validity period, i.e., signatures
made before the TIMESPEC of option "\-f" or after the TIMESPEC of option "\-t"
are not valid. The corresponding TIMESPEC must be of the format
"YYYY\-MM\-DD[_HH:MM:SS]". The default values are "2009\-06\-01 00:00:00
(publication date of FIPS 186\-3)" and the current system date, respectively.

.PP
The program returns a non\-zero value on error, e.g., if the detached signature
is invalid or no admissible public key is found in KEYFILE.
